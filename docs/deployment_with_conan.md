Deployment with conan
============

Cmake (version 3.15 or above) and python3 (3.6 or above) are required.

Install virtual environment
------------
To install virtualenv in python3 you need to input the next command:
~~~bash
pip install virtualenv
~~~

Here is an example how it looks in my environment:
![install virtualenv image](images/install_virtualenv.jpg "Install virtualenv for python3")

### If you have python2 as your default interpreter, you need to say explicitly to use python3.
~~~bash
pip3 install virtualenv
~~~

### If you do not have pip or pip3 you need to install it.
How to do this can be found [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
